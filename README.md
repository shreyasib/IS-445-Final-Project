 ## Introduction
The yellow taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

3. Split columns
4. Remove outliers and invalid data
5. Fixing data types




## Data Analysis and Visualizaion
Q1: Which days have the highest taxi usage?

Q2: Which hours of the day typically have a high taxi usage?

Q3: Which is the most popular Vendor?

Q4: Which is the preferred payment method?

Q5: What is the average passenger count in a taxi?

Q6: What is the trend between Fare amount and the distance covered by taxis?

Q7: What is the trend between Tip amount and the distance covered by taxis? Does more distance covered result in more tip?

Q8: Which days cover the most distance by taxis?

Q9: What is the average tip by Time of Day?

Q10: What is the average Fare amount by Time of Day?
